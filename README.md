# ao3_history_copy

I made this esentially because I'm stupid. I'm stupid enough to have accidentally deleted my history on two different ocassions (hitting the clear history button) and when the third time eventually comes I want to be prepared. It is likely that I won't recover everything but at least I won't spend the whole day searching through my browser's history in hopes of getting a quarter of my marked for later page back.

## How does it work?

This program lets you make a security copy of your <a href="https://archiveofourown.org">archive of our own</a> history and your marked for later page. It creates two documents, history.txt and marked_for_later.txt. Each of them contains all the urls of the works in your history and your marked for later page. 

#### Download folder

The default Download folder will be used unless you specify at the beggining a path to another location

## Usage

You need to have python installed to execute the program. You can either download the project zip manually or clicking in Code -> Download zip and then you just have to execute main.py (inside src)
Check that you have all the modules that are imported installed

```bash
wget https://github.com/encars28/ao3_history_copy/archive/main.zip
cd ao3_history/src
python main.py
```
